# ICRC Ledger Types

These types are deployed in crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/icrc-ledger-types

They are forked here because the ones in crates.io use an old versions of candid not compatible with the one in the canister-sdk.
When an updated version is published on crates.io, this package will be removed.
